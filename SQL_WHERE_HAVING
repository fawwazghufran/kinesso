In a SQL statement, the WHERE clause specifies criteria that field values must meet for the
records that contain the values to be included in the query results.

For example, suppose that you want the telephone number of a customer, but you only remember that the customer's last name is Nesso. 
Instead of looking at all the telephone numbers in your database, you could use a WHERE clause to limit the results and make it 
easier to find the telephone number that you want.

eg: WHERE [LastName]='Nesso'


//This is a query that displays the CustomerID of the customers that have currently ordered products using a correlated subquery.
SELECT DISTINCT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.LastName
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Customers.Age < 50;

//This is a query that displays the details of the products whose name starts with 'Sha'.
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE SUBSTR(ProductName, 1, 3) = 'Mulberry';


It is not a predefined rule but  in a good number of the SQL queries, we use WHERE prior to GROUP BY and HAVING after GROUP BY.
The Where clause acts as a pre filter where as Having as a post filter.


The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include district with more than 7 customers:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), District
FROM Customers
GROUP BY District
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 7;
